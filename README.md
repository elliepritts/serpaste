Serpaste is a tool I created to speed up workflow at my production artist gig. I use this tool to gather screenshots of lengthy menus, like the settings menu on the iPhone, and create one simple image of the entire thing. This process normally would take around 15 minutes to do with photoshop from scratch. Now it only takes a few seconds :)
